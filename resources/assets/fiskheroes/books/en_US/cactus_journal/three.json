Last week I was ambushed by a group of bandits who found me while they were trying to raid a temple. It gets so cold at night that those temples are one of the only ways to stay warm at night and not freeze to death. I honestly"

Whether it's the hope that one day I'll be able to see my wife and kids and explain and apologize for everything, or maybe it's just my brain telling me not to give up. Either way, let's just say those bandits will be picking thorns out of themselves for a while after what happened. I discovered a new ability of mine when they attacked me, so I guess it"

      "text": "was a slightly positive encounter. I guess if I had to name it I'd call it a starburst. No no, a thornsplosion? No that's also dumb. I don't know what I would call it, but it was intense, and took a lot of energy out of me. It just kind of happened, I didn't try to do it, I think my body naturally did it as a response to danger. I don't think it'll be doing that again"

      "text": "any time soon considering I practically had to crawl out of there when I was done with them. Have I mentioned yet that using the thorns hurts, a lot? Well it does. I just want this nightmare to end. A few weeks ago I was walking around looking for an oasis, and I thought I saw my wife wondering the desert. My worst fears hit me. I thought that the people who did this to me found her and punished"
